Schema Design Strategies:

Embedded Data Models: Designing schemas to embed related data within a single document can improve read performance by reducing the need for joins.
Normalization vs. Denormalization: Choosing between normalized (using references between documents) and denormalized (embedding related data) data models based on query patterns and data access requirements.
Indexing Strategies:

Compound Indexes: Creating indexes on multiple fields to optimize queries that filter on multiple criteria.
Text Indexes: Using text indexes for efficient text search queries.
Geospatial Indexes: Storing and querying geospatial data for location-based services.
Aggregation Framework:

Pipeline Stages: Using various stages like $match, $group, $project, and $lookup to perform complex aggregation operations across multiple documents.
Aggregation Optimization: Techniques like using indexes, $sort and $limit stages strategically, and leveraging $facet for multi-faceted aggregations.
Replication and High Availability:

Replica Sets: Configuring replica sets for automatic failover and data redundancy.
Read Preferences: Directing read operations to different replica set members based on requirements (e.g., reading from secondaries for scaling read operations).
Sharding:

Shard Key Selection: Choosing an appropriate shard key to evenly distribute data across shards and optimize query performance.
Query Routing: Understanding how MongoDB routes queries to the correct shard based on the shard key.
Transactions:

Multi-Document Transactions: Ensuring data consistency across multiple documents within a single transaction.
Retryable Writes: Handling transient network errors and automatically retrying write operations.
Change Streams:

Real-time Data Changes: Using change streams to listen for real-time changes in the database, enabling reactive applications.
GridFS:

Storing Large Files: Using GridFS for storing and retrieving large files (e.g., images, videos) that exceed the BSON document size limit of 16 MB.
Security:

Authentication and Authorization: Configuring MongoDB for secure access using authentication mechanisms (e.g., SCRAM, x.509 certificates) and role-based access control (RBAC).
Performance Optimization:

Profiling and Monitoring: Using tools like MongoDB Compass, mongostat, and mongotop to monitor database performance and identify bottlenecks.
Query Optimization: Analyzing and optimizing query performance using the explain() method and index utilization.
